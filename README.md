# Algorithms-Patterns

üöß This repo is under construction. It's meant for note-taking purposes only (for now). Later, when it's more organized, feel free to use it as you see fit, but please do your own due diligence.
This repo will cover some of the patterns one can use when solving data structures and algorithms questions. The language used in this repo (if any) is <b>Javascript</b>.

&#8226; The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray. <br>
    &#8226; There are some cases where you shouldn‚Äôt use the Two Pointer approach such as in a singly linked list where you can‚Äôt move in a backwards direction. An example of when to use the Fast and Slow pattern is when you‚Äôre trying to determine if a linked list is a palindrome.
