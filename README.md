# Algorithms-Patterns

🚧 This repo is under construction. It's meant for note-taking purposes only (for now). Later, when it's more organized, feel free to use it as you see fit, but please do your own due diligence.
This repo will cover some of the patterns one can use when solving data structures and algorithms questions. The language used in this repo (if any) is <b>Javascript</b>.

&#8226; The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray. <br>
      &#8226; Searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list; for example, when you have to compare each element of an array to its other elements.<br>
    &#8226; There are some cases where you shouldn’t use the Two Pointer approach such as in a singly linked list where you can’t move in a backwards direction (if that's the case, consider the runner technique(a.k.a fast and slow). An example of when to use the Fast and Slow pattern is when you’re trying to determine if a linked list is a palindrome.
